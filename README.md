# ARENA Coursework Practice

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks I created to practice and reinforce the concepts taught in the [ARENA course](https://arena-chapter0-fundamentals.streamlit.app/), a comprehensive program designed by [Callum McDougall](https://x.com/calsmcdougall). The course serves as an excellent introduction to **Transformers**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Mechanistic Interpretability**.

## About This Repo

The notebooks here reflect my hands-on exploration of key topics from the ARENA curriculum. They include exercises, implementations, and experiments tied to the course material, offering a practical companion to the theoretical foundations.

## Topics Covered
- Fundamentals of neural networks and deep learning (Chapter 0: Fundamentals)
- Transformer architecture and mechanistic interpretability (Chapter 1: Transformer Interpretability)
- Reinforcement learning concepts and applications (Chapter 2: Reinforcement Learning)
- Evaluation techniques for large language models (LLMs) (Chapter 3: LLM Evaluations)
